# The Economics of Happiness

The idea is to annotate countries with as many economic indicators as possible and use that to predict the World Happiness Report scores for various years.

Since 2002, the World Happiness Report has used statistical analysis to determine the world's happiest countries https://worldhappiness.report/

The WHR data is at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness

We will then use EDA, models, and model interpretability to determine which factors contribute the most to predicting the Happiness Score

## Tasks

1. Find more relevant data to annotate each country  
2. Create conceptual and physical models for the data  
3. Exentend the EDA  
4. Build predictive models  
5. Model- Interpretability
6. Game theoretic SHAP analysis
